# Project Title: A/B Testing Analysis for New Search Feature


## Project Overview:

The project aims to analyze the engagement and success metrics associated with the introduction of a new search feature on a web page. The objective is to evaluate user interactions and metrics to determine the efficacy of the implemented search feature.

##  User Actions Tracked for Measuring Search Engagement:

##### Number of Search Queries: Tracking the frequency of user searches.
##### "View Details" Clicks: Monitoring the clicks on the "view details" button.
##### Actions for "Add to List": Counting the items added to users' shopping lists.
##### Shopping List Completion Rate: Measuring the rate of completed shopping lists (share or print).

### Metrics for Reporting the Feature Performance:

##### Conversion Rate: Number of users completing shopping lists (purchases).
##### Average Items Added per User: Average items added to shopping lists.
##### Bounce Rate from Search Results: Rate of users bouncing off from search results.
##### Average Number of Sessions Launched: Average sessions initiated by users.
##### Average Time Spent on Search Results Page: Duration spent on search results.
##### Query Reformulation Rate: Rate at which users reformulate their queries.

### Determining Feature Success:

##### Monitoring Search Response Times: Ensuring fast and reliable search results.
##### Analyzing User Engagement Evolution: Tracking engagement changes over time.
##### Test vs Control Analysis: Comparing metrics like conversion rate, time spent, sessions between test and control groups.
##### User Feedback and Ratings: Gathering user satisfaction data through feedback.

### Additional Data Insights:

User Journey Analysis: Examining user actions post and pre-search (e.g., add to cart).
Search Algorithm Enhancement: Training algorithms with synonyms, contextual words.
Relevant Flyer Page Positioning: Positioning relevant flyer pages with retrieved products.
AB Test Result Analysis:

### Data Loading and Cleaning: Addressing null values, data types, duplicates, and data consistency.
### Outlier Detection and Removal: Identifying and handling extreme values.
### Result Statistics: Insights derived from test vs control group analysis.

## Summary of Findings:

Higher returning users in the test group.
Consistent outperformance in hosted sessions by the test group.
Differentiated impact on time spent and flyer clicks between the test and control groups.
Increased success in converting inactive users to activated status in the test group.

## Conclusion:

The A/B testing analysis indicates promising outcomes for the new search feature implementation. However, distinct user behavior patterns require further investigation for better comprehension.

This report provides an overview of the A/B testing project, outlining key metrics, insights, and conclusions drawn from the analysis of the new search feature's performance.
